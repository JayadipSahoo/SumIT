# Article Summarizer Using AI ü§ñ


Article Summarizer is a web application that utilizes the power of the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API to generate concise summaries of any article. With this tool, users can quickly extract the key points and main ideas from lengthy texts, saving time and enhancing comprehension.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the article or provide a URL to fetch the content. It then sends the article to the OpenAI API for processing and retrieves the generated summary. The summary is displayed to the user, allowing them to access the important information without reading the entire article.

* **JavaScript** - JavaScript is a high-level programming language commonly used for web development. It enables developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
* **React.js** - React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their application.
* **Redux Toolkit** - Redux Toolkit is a package that helps developers to write Redux logic more easily. It provides a set of tools and utilities for managing application state and reducing boilerplate code.
* **OpenAI API** - The [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) provides access to powerful language processing capabilities. It can be used to generate human-like text, summarize articles, translate languages, and more.
