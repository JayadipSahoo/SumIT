## Overview

Article Summarizer is a web application that utilizes the power of the OpenAI API to generate concise summaries of any article. With this tool, users can quickly extract the key points and main ideas from lengthy texts, saving time and enhancing comprehension.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the article or provide a URL to fetch the content. It then sends the article to the OpenAI API for processing and retrieves the generated summary. The summary is displayed to the user, allowing them to access the important information without reading the entire article.

## Features
